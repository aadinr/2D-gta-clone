## What is in this repository? ##

It contains my old, unfinished 2D game that was heavily inspired by Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2.
It was written using C++ and SFML library.
Sadly, all the assets are missing, the only thing that survived is source code.
You are free to do anything you like with it.
